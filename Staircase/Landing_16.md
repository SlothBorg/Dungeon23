The stairs level out into a **stone hall** that **slops upwards**, at the far end you can see some creatures working, hammering and chiseling.

The creatures have a **cube-shaped body**, six **mechanical legs** jut out from the bottom. Its head is a small, metal sphere, with a **dozens of glowing purple eyes** evenly spaced around it's head. Their body is a **dull gray metal**, with **gears and machinery** visible through small openings in its surface. They move with jerky, mechanical gait as they go about their work.
