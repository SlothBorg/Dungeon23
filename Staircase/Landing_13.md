A group of **Elves in flowing robes and pointed hats**, stand before a **large metal door**, made of **horizontal slats** stacked one on top of the other, a large chain dangles from the right side attached to a wheel at the top.

Across the surface of the metal slats a **repeating starburst pattern** has been painstakingly carved. The surface is marred by a few soot and oil stains.

Across the middle in shining yellow letters is writen "Mark's Garage".

Soot, and foul smelling smoke seep from under the door and around the edges.
