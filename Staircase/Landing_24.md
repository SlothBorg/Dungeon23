A **pool of water** 20ft at most across sits before you, floating in the mist.

in the middle of the pool, a **water logged** **wooden door and frame** bobs water, barely keeping afloat.

The door is a jar, spilling **pale blue light** up and outwards. **faint music** of an indiscernible type floats across the still water.
