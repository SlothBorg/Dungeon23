A group of seven Satyrs, stand in a circle heads bent intently discussing something.

As you approach one looks up at you, their eyes lock with yours they stomp a hoofed foot and shout out.

*"You their! Come here and put this silly discussion to rest!"*

---

* They are debating which way to go, as best as you can tell they seem to think they are at a crossroads and can't fine north on their compass.
* From your point of view, they have stopped on an abnormally wide step in the middle of the stair.
