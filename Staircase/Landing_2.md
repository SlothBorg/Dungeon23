You emerge into a **small wooden room**, a **cozy fire** dancing in a **corner fireplace**. The wall in front of you is dominated by a large hanging door, a frame of old wood suspended on rails.
Instead of wood slats the door is made of a **curtain of light**, a single large ring serves as a door handle.

A **plump** being of **pale yellow skin** and many arms sits before the fire smoking a **many tubed water pipe**, it beckons you over with several of it's arms.
