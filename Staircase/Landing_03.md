The landing is **cold**, you shiver and your **breath hangs misty in the air**. Amid the icicles and forst on the stone wall, you see a door made of alternating bands of **black iron** and **polished brass**.

As you look at it the door shimmer and move under the ice.

*The door is not real, but it still leads somewhere...*
