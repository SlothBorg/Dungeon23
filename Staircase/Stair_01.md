The stairs before you are **rickety, rusted iron**, **spiraling up and away** at a **30 degree angle**.

You see beings walking up the stairs with out any issue, despite it's angle, beings seem to pass each other without any issue on the cramped stair.

The whole stair shakes filling the air with a low vibration.
