The landing before you is a large **stone patio**, **warm sunlight** fills the area and **birds chirp** and flit from tree to tree.

**Pale marble stairs** rise from the far side and disappear into a **warm mist**.

A **large Fire** roars to onside, slowly **rotating** as it does you can see an **opening in the flames**, in which hangs a large black iron door knocker.
The fire is painfully bright to look at.

A group of **Dwarves** in flowing pastel togas lounge on stone slabs, sipping wine and reciting poetry.
