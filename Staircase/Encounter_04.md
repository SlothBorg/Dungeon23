From the mist shadows appear, coalescing into **tall gaunt eight armed insect like humanoids**.

Seven of them appear surrounding you, they chitter to each other in a language you can not understand.

After a moment, the shortest of them steps forward waving it's arms and peering into your eyes, you feel it's workds in your mind.

*Greetings travelers... we wish you no harm. Now turn over your valuables and we can all be on out ways!*
