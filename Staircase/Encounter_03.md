A **festive** looking **precession**, winds it's way down the stairs towards you.

In the lead, is a **six-armed squat blue skinned** being, holding a long wooden pole topped with a dangling **metal sign** that reads *Everywhere Inn*.

Behind him a troop of dwaves juggle **casks and barrels**, next a centaur ladend down with tents and sheets, behind that more and stranger beings carry the contents of an Inn and tavern.

All of them are merry, jostling, joking and singing in a myriad of languages.
