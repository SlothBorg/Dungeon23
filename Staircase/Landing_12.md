A **Gleaming Bronze Archway** dominates this small wooden platform, **gnarled roots** pour out of the archway, widdening as if enveloping the space. 

You pause to catch your breath, and realize that the **doorway** seems to be sucking in all the air on the landing, as if taking a deep breath.

Three gnomes are passed out amid the **gnarle   11rd roots**, they appear as if they were trying to climb inside of them!
