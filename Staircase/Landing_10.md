A dozen or more, **simple wooden** doors are piled haphazardly in one corner, as if left there. 

Each door has a **carved mouth** upon it, some **decorated**, some **plain**. Each mouth is moving and muttering, to itself or it's neighbors you do not know.

The **language of these doors** is one of low creeks and groans, you can't understand it.
