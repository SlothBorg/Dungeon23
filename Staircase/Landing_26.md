The sound of merriment and smells of an Inn fill the air, before you reach the large wide landing.

A large sheet metal sign reads *Everywhere Inn*. Tables and chairs are spread across the landing, groups of patrons at each one.

A single large bar dominates one side of the landing, with wooden stools against it. Overhead, dozens of large cloth sheets and banners form a kind of roof.

A portly three-armed hafling pushes past you carrying a tray loaded with mugs and fresh bread.
