A glinting blade of polished steel. Etched on upon it's surface is the skyline of a city you do not recognize. 

Around the guard in a foreign script is writen something. You hope it's the name of the city, or some clue.

### Mechanics

The script says in effect: *Who weld this blade, shall rule*. The sword grants rulership of the city, both legally and magically. The sword has been cast out from the city.
