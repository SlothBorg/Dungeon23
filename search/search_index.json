Thick ropes of spider web stretch across the vast opening forming pathways, platforms to walk upon, and even a balcony of sort along the perimeter of the pit. A series of small shoddily constructed wooden buildings are lashed to, built on top of, and even seemingly built through, the strands of spider silk . None of the buildings look structurally sound, each one seeming to rely on its neighbors for support. Each building has spider web woven throughout it, securing it to the main web and lashing it to the other buildings. You see no hint of flame in the small ramshackle village, though some buildings do have a pale blue or green glow emanating from between the larger gaps in the wood. High above in the pit, you can see large spheres of some material, suspend from yet more spider silk . Each sphere glows with bio-luminescent algae casting the whole area in a pale blue-green light. There is just enough light to make out a large banner with a crudely drawn spider upon it in the center of this village. More Info: The goblins aren't outright hostile to any intruders, but they are wary of outsiders and will stop anyone from bringing fire onto the webbing, especially into their village. While the village is ramshackle, there is a fair amount of valuable loot contained within, often taken from the corpses of their \"deity\". The village is intended to be reminiscent of Goblin Town , as depicted in the movie adaptation of The Hobbit.

You feel uneasy , the pit of your stomach twists , your hair stands up on end , and your nostrils burn and eyes water at an acrid tinge to the air . In the center of the room, standing proud amidst the rubble, is a large metal arc describing a third of a circle. It crackles and hums with energy growing and subsiding, giving the room an almost organic pulse. Dust hangs in the air, heavy with static charge. Slumped against the Metal Edifice is the limb of some great beast, somehow preserved, blood and gore still ooze from where it was cut clean off the body. Great talons have carved deep gouges in the stone, and you can see wicked looking spines along the limb. More Info: The metal arc is a part of a transit portal, long damaged, but still potent and possibly usable. Time slows the closer to the portal you get, though not noticeably to anyone within the room. The limb here is from a Greater Demon who was attempting to pass through the portal when it was destroyed. The magic of the portal, shattered and broken as it is, keeps the limb \"fresh\". If moved the limb has enough magical energies in it that it will put up one last fight, before starting to rot at a normal rate. Rumor & Local Lore There are rumors that there are still working Transit Portals in The Below . Even broken magic items and edifices can be a powerful tool, if you know what you are doing.

This room has seen death almost as often as it has shown it. More Info: Seeing every future possibility of your own death is a traumatic event - an event that can kill. Surviving the room will strengthen ones' resolve in the face of horror and death in the future. If someone holding the wardsone of Death (see Room 22 ) faces the visions and survives, the stone will feel warm to the touch, and a single rune upon its surface will pulse faintly with an inner light.
