Once a grand spice market, it has now been taken over as a university, it's wide plazas and open market turned into gardens and lecture halls. The warehouses, now serve as libraries, storage and laboratories.

A sprawling campus of large warm sandstone buildings, large gardens, open plazas, minaret filed with dust tomes and large amphitheatre lecture halls.
