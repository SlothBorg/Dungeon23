## The Spice District

### Influences

Islamic Golden Age, *One Thousand and One Nights*, Al-Qadim, Arab and Moorish architecture

### Description

**The Spice District** is a colorful and grand, albeit old and word, place full of minaret, wide gardens, libraries, museums and other places of learning. 

Before **The Transition**, it was the university and scholar district of a far grander city, now it is but a pale shadow of it's former glory.

In it's many winding alleys, merchants hawk strange ware, scholars lecture to passerby's, and tea and coffee shops welcome those seeking a respite for the day. 

At night the air is filled with music and the sound of conversation. The darkened alleys become dangerous, full of thieves, and conspirators.
