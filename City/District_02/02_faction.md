## The Guild of Gondoliers

### Background

Originally outcasts who didn't or couldn't find a home within another district, they took to living on boats and traveling between, as more refugees entered the city their services became more in demand.

All full members of the guild possess **The Knowledge**, a full map of all the canals. Through magical rites, this knowledge is shared and connected, so when one Gondolier learns of a new path, they all do.  


### Goals

* Maintain control of the Inter-District waterways.
* Keep the waterways free of obstacles or threats.
* Ensure they, and they alone, know all available routes.

### Secrets

* They know the old canals and secret ways, allowing them to travel unseen. This is not a service they offer openly, or lightly.
