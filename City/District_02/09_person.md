## Vesper 

### Reputation

Vesper is a know thief, and an accomplished spy. Difficult to read in any situation, Vesper was born and raised in Bastion and takes great pride in the fact.

Who Vesper's parents where/are and their whereabouts are unknown, and the topic has resulted in the few known violent outbursts from Vesper.

Their dry and sarcastic wit has been known to get them into as much trouble as it has gotten them out of.

### Agenda

* Gain wealth and power, in order to rise in the cult.
* Use their power and influence in the cult to learn where their family is, and hunt them down for abandoning them.

### Secrets

Vesper joined a cult dedicated to a Shadow demon when they were younger, and is frustrated with how slowly they have risen in the Cults ranks.
