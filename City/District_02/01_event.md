The **gondola** you are on is jostled, as another gondola bumps into yours.

The group in the other gondola stares at you angrily, one member drunkenly rising and pointing at his shirt now stained.

*Look what you did! Ruined this is! and it's all your fault!* 

He points an accusatory finger at you.
