The bloody stairs lead down further into the city and finally open onto a board largely flat plaza. 

In the center a now dry fountain with carved statues rises from the stone. 

Scattered about the plaza are twisted and mangled corpses dressed in similar regalia to the mercenaries from earlier.

At the far side a body falls from the shadows, as the shadow twists and moves oozing and flowing like liquid.

It rolls over the ground and gathers up a corpse enveloping it as it raises it into the air.

The shadow being is a greater shadow demon.
