As the door swings open, the scents of a banquet fill your nostrils.

Before you a long table set with fine dinner ware set atop a crimson cloth. Piled high with foods of all manor.

At the head of the table a corpulent figure hunches gobbling meat off a bone. 

Between mouthfuls the figure gestures at you, *Come. Sit. Eat your fill!* it is a command.
