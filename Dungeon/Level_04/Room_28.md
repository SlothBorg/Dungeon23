You peer through the metal door way into a room of broken walkways and rubble.

As your eyes adjust, the grim reality of the scene before you becomes clear, hundreds of corpses lay mangled among the rubble and ruin.

Several golems stand vigilant against long vanquished foes. Here and there glinting weapons and armor protrude from the rubble.

* In addition to the golems there are several magical items, and the lingering magical energies of many spells, giving the whole place a magical aura.
