The door before you seems out of place, the old wood is aged and decayed, the surrounding stone is smooth and clean as if carved yesterday.

The room is shrouded in an eerie mist that clings to the rotting wooden of the many bunk beds within.

As you push open the door, a corpse stirs in each bed rising to it's feet and standing still heads focused on you.


On the far wall you note a rack of weapons, at the foot of each bunk bed is a chest and several spears. 

Each of the corpses wears the tatters of a uniform.
