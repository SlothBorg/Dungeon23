The stone archway leads off the plaza and into a store room or old shop.

The room is filled with broken furniture and shattered fixtures.

Based on the gore and broken bodies it's clear a battle took place here recently.

One mercenary still stands holding a black sword at the ready, moving in jerky motions fending off unseen attackers.

As the mercenary turns to parry an unseen blow you see the back of their head has been cut off, and their spine in splintered through their mail and tunic.

Some unknown force keeps this poor soul animated.

### More Info:

The sword the mercenary welds is a powerful magical item, allowing the wielder to shrug off blows that might kill another warrior...
The obvious curse is that it does not allow it's wielder to die.
