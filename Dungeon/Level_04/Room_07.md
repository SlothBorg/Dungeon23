The room is bare and empty save for a glass pillar in the center.

The glass pillar is hallow, and filled with innumerable coins of all sizes, metals and denominations.

You recognize a few and far far more are foreign to you.

Across the room a simple wooden door is slightly ajar.

### More Info:

* The glass is easily breakable, doing so however shuts and locks both doors.
* Hidden above the room is a reservoir of coins, enough to more than fill the room, trapping and cursing those inside.
