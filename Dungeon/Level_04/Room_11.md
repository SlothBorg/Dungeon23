Tatters of once beautiful tapestries adorn the wall, piles for rotted and rusted furniture have been pushed to the corner of this dank room.

In the center amid innumerable scrawled sigils and equations sit hunched a woman in flowing moth eaten fabric. 

She whimpers and rocks on her heals, all you can make out is something about it not being right, it not looking right, in being wrong.

As you watch the shadows on the far wall shift of their own acord, the furniture near it collapses and rots away.

A rasping sound of rough fabric dragged over stone fills your ears ringing loudly, and yet you know the room is still quite.

A sense of dread fills you as you see a strange gnarled hand start to reach out from the shadows.

The hunched figure lets out an ear-piercing shriek and bolts upright.
