You step onto the narrow stone bridge, risking a glance down you see far bellow ruins lit by dim lanterns.

Carved into and out of the stone far below are buildings, built on top of each other in tires rising half way up the vast distance.

Tattered banners and flags adorn the buildings, hinting at the past glories of the city.

You hear the heavy foot falls of armored marching, and a moment later you hear the lyrics to a marching song from across the bridge.

A group of heavily armed mercenaries, come marching into view across the bridge.

### More Info:

* The mercenaries while otherwise reasonable, demand the bridge cleared.

#### Faction & Inhabitant

* The mercenaries were hired to recover an item of great value, and are facing a rapidly approaching deadline to get it back.
