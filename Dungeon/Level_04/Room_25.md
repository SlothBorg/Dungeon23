Echoing from deeper within the workshop is the grinding of gears as some great machine comes to life.

Acrid smoke burns your nostrils and the grinding intensifies to an ear splitting roar. 

From above a large grate of blackened metal grinds open and large chains start to lower into the room.

Clinging to the top are a group of dwarves wearing red cloaks and brandishing weapons, they drop down and face you menacingly.

*Loot or your life, which will it be intruder!* The closest growls at you!
