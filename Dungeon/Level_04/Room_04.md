The ornate door swings open onto a narrow ledge. 

The sheer drop is at least several hundred feet, far far below you can see the dim glow of fire or lava.

On the far side of the chasm a single cracked statue is all that remains of what was once a magnificent chamber. 

In it's cupped hands rests a pale blue crystal orb.

### More Info:

* The orb is a crystal of seeing.
* The chasm descends into the depths of the below, and while hazardous to descend is a viable way down.
