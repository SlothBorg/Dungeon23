You step into a massive chamber that was once a bustling factory floor, now long abandoned and covered in a thick layer of dust.

The walls are lined with rusted machinery, and the air is thick with dust.

In the center of the room, you see a large, ornate control panel that hums with a faint energy.

Set atop the panel is a molding manual of some sort and an ornate brass rod topped with a large ruby.
