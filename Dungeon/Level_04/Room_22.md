The bent and broken grate leads into a partially collapsed sewer, thankfully long disused. 

While most of the passages are blocked on winding tunnel chipped into the living stone leads to a cracked and broken wall.

Through which you can see glimpses of a well appointed study, now covered in dust and the occasional broken brick.

The broken wall crumbles under your weight, the slight movement stirs the dust inside the study you smell a sharp ozone scent.
