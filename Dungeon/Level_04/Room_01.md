The crack widens into a large chamber, a cave with tiled wall and wooden furnishings.

The air is stale and unmoving, the scent of age lingers. 

From the ceiling water drips at a painfully slow pace. The floor and overfull bookshelves show no sign of damp or rot.

A giant hourglass has been set into the wall, it slowly drops grain of sand after grain of sand.

Next too the hour glass is a wooden door barred with a large wooden beam.

In the very midle of the room, a strange orange red orb hangs in the air VERY slowly expanding and opening like a flower made of fire.

### More Info:

* Time is slowed to a crawl in this room. For every 3 hours that passes within only one minute passes outside.
* If the hour glass is broken, time rushes to catch up, Anyone and anything inside age 300 years in the span of an instance. And then 3 hours per minute spent within for the next day.
* The flower in the center of the room is a Fireball spell that was cast right as the time slowing effect took hold.
