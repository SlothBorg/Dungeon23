The air in this room is thick with the sickly sweet stench of rot and decay.

The walls are covered in thick oozing mold, the floor is slick with a mixture of the mold and dirt forming a thick layer of muck.

In the corner of the room, a pile of bones lies scattered about, picked clean by some unknown creature.

As you enter, you hear a faint buzzing sound coming from somewhere deeper within the room.

As you move through the room you see a swarm of large flies buzzing around a decaying corpse in the center of the chamber.

As you watch, the flies coalesce into a hulking, insectoid monstrosity with razor-sharp mandibles and chitinous armor.

It seems to be guarding a chest partially buried in the muck.
