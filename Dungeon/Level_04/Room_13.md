You hear the argument before you finish climbing the stairs.

The stars open onto a large round chamber, inside a slab of white stone serves as a tabel a group of ogres are gathered around arguing loudly.

Jabbing fingers at one another and bellowing, the source of the disharmony seems to be the large macuahuitt resting in a pool of blood upon the stone.

As they argue you notice dust floating down from the ceiling, looking up you see a small hole, the size of a finger, as you watch a rotting finger sratches its way through the hole.

The finger seems to be trying to dig the hole out further.

### More Info:

* Above this chamber the undead from the great pit far above have slowly over hundreds of years dug a tunnels. 
* Should the ceiling break, then untold numbers of shambling corpses would fall into the room.
* The macuahuitl is magical, it drains the blood of any it cuts, granting the welder some of their strength and vitality.
