The small door tucked under a lavish tapestry opens into dark and dank space. The scent of unwashed bodies and metal permeates the air.

As your eyes adjust, you see dozens of metal cages, against the wall and more hanging from the celling many contain bodies, some even moving.

A whimpering voices pleads with you *help us...*

### More Info:

The cages are full of the "cattle" the vampires kept, most have been here quite a while, drained and drained again.
Many are sick.
At least one is in the early stages of vampirism unbeknownst to them.
