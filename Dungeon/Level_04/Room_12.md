The room is dim and cramped, cobwebs hang from the vaulted ceiling.

Rows of cobweb coated statues have been packed into the room.

It is clear no living being has entered the room in quite some time.

As you step into the room your foot crunches on something, looking down you see the bone you stepped upon, dozens more lay scattered around.

Looking back up, you see a statue shudder and under the cobwebs you can see just bone.
