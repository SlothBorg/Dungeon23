The first thing about the room that strikes you is the opulent display of excess on display everywhere.
The walls are adorned with gilded mirrors and paintings depicting extravagance, while the floor is covered in plush red carpet.
The air is thick with the smoke of incense and the scent of perfume, and the sound of soft music plays in the background.

At the far end of the room  a group of finely dressed individuals lounging on a large couch, sipping from crystal goblets.
These are the members of the faction that currently inhabits the room, and they seem to be enjoying the luxurious surroundings.
One of them, a tall and imposing figure with a wide grin, notices your presence and beckons you over.  *"What brings you to our humble abode?"*

As you approach, you can't help but feel a little uneasy. Despite the lavish decor, there is an air of greed and selfishness that permeates the room.
You get the sense that these individuals are more interested in indulging their own desires than anything else.
As you stare you notice a blood stain here, a whiff of an odd scent. The thick liquid they are drinking looks like blood. Is that painting on skin?
Is the drumstick that one is eating more of a human thigh?
