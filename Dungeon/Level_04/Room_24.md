A broken archway leads deeper into the city, beyond is a workshop.

Cracked workbenches and tables are piled high with half finished pieces of work.

In the center a large mechanical humanoid stands amid scaffolding, parts to it scattered about.

### More Info:

* The mechanical humanoid is a mostly finished golem
* If activated the golem will run to defend the city from long defeated enemies.
* The control rod is not present in the workshop, it would most likely be found at the site of the battle for the city.
