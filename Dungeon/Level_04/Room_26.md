As you climb up the chains into the room, you are assaulted with the scent of hot metal and oil.

The walls are lined with rusted pipes and gears, and conveyor belts weave their way through the room, covered in a thick layer of dust and debris.

In the corner of the room, you see a towering, humanoid automaton. It appears to be the last remaining worker in this abandoned factory, its metal frame stained with oil and rust.

Its glowing red eyes snap to attention as you enter, and it begins to lumber towards you menacingly.

As the automaton moves you a safe built into the wall behind it. The safe appears to have been untouched since the factory was abandoned, and there may be valuable blueprints or machinery plans hidden within.

### More Info:

* The automaton is not actually attacking and if dodged will head to another room to manage a furnace.
* The safe contains valuable schematics and several bars of valuable ores
