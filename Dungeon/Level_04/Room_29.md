Among the carnage and ruin of the battle field a single area has seemingly been cleared.

A rusted and dented but seemingly intact and functional harch door set into the stone floor.

It leads down a cylindrical shaft, and into a small round chamber dominated by the massive maw of a black iron furnace.

The furnace's maw is open cold and dead awaiting someone to once more re-ignite it.
