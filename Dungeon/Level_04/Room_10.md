The long hall is flanked at even intervals by gilded suits of armor. 

On the far-side between two massive bronze doors, a statue of a female with dozens of eyes, each a glinting jewel glowers down at you.

### More Info:

* The suits of armor will naturally animate and attack anyone who tries to remove the gems from the eye sockets.
