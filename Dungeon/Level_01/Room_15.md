The sloping **passageway** is broken and filled with rubble ahead, with a gaping hole in the ceiling and floor. Some great tunneling beast clearly came through here.

As you look more closely at the rubble, you notice a **scale** and then another, all covered in dirt. A **large tooth** is embedded in a slab of stone.

The passageway shudders with far off movement.
