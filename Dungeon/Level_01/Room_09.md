The tight tunnel is littered with desiccated corpses wrapped in **spider silk**. They are caught in webs, dangling from the ceiling, scattered on the floor, and stuck to the wall with strands of the sticky gossamer. More silk threads stretch across the tunnel, and cling to the edges and corners.

A rockfall has blocked the path ahead. **Spider webs** ooze around and over the rocks, filling any holes the rocks don't. The scent of **fresh dirt and something sweet** fills the narrow tunnel. The occasional **skittering noise** pierces the silence.

### More Info:

* Beyond the rockfall a **giant spider abomination** (Dryder, Shelob, or similar) has made their lair. While "monstrous" the spider is intelligent, although its ability to speak is limited. It views this area as its territory, and anyone else as intruders at best and food at worse.
* **A tribe of goblins** has taken up the "worship" of the spider, offering tribute and praise. The spider is amused by this and mostly refrains from eating the goblins.

#### Faction & Inhabitant

* The **tribe of goblins**, who have recently taken to "worshipping" the **spider abomination**. They have adopted **spider motifs**, **spider silk**, and try to generally emulate their new "deity".
* The spider abomination has spent so long in the dark as to become sensitive to bright lights, and will take anything brighter than a dim lantern as an act of hostility.

#### Rumor & Local Lore

* Numerous abominations live with in **The Below**, some contain within them prized alchemical components.
* Giant spider silk is prized for its high strength and light weight.
