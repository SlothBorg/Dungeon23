A **short corridor** opens onto a **cool cave**. A **crystal clear pool** of **shallow water** dominates the middle.

As your gaze catches the pool, you see swirling images, you see yourself... dying in hundreds of different ways.

As the shock and horror clutches you, you know each vision to be a true future. As you watch, the visions slowly melt together, until only one is left.

As the visions play in your mind and eyes, you notice skeletal remnants huddled in the corners of the room: a skull here, a skeletal hand there.

This room has seen death almost as often as it has shown it.

### More Info:

* Seeing every future possibility of your own death is a traumatic event - an event that can kill.
* Surviving the room will strengthen ones' resolve in the face of horror and death in the future.
* If someone holding the **wardsone of Death** (see [Room 22](Room_22.md)) faces the visions and survives, the stone will feel warm to the touch, and a single rune upon its surface will pulse faintly with an inner light.
