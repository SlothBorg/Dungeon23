A **short passage** leads to a **plain staircase**. It descends into a **small stone chamber** lit by a large **chandelier** filled with hundreds of flickering candles.  

**Heaps of coins** glitter and sparkle. Gems and decorative items stud the piles. Loose coins are scattered across the floor.

Among the opulent wealth are **skeletons**. You see bones sticking out from the closest heap of coins, as if it was trying to swim.

On the far side, another set of plain stairs rises to a corridor.

### More Info:

* Test of avarice! The wardstone granted by Statue 1 in [Room 22](Room_22.md) opens the door to this area.
* All of the wealth will turn to dust upon being removed from the chamber.
* If any of the wealth is moved beyond the confines of the lowered area, the whole treasure area falls into a long shaft. The bottom of the pit is filled with yet more skeletons.
* If someone holding the wardsone of Avarice passes through the chamber without taking any of the wealth, the stone will feel warm to the touch, and a single rune upon its surface will pulse faintly with an inner light.

#### Rumor & Local Lore

* There is some basis to the stereotype of dwarves as greedy and gold crazed, but all master and control these urges, just as humans control theirs.
