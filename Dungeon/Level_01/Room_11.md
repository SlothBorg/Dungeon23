What was once a **grand hall** of some sort has collapsed into a **rubble-strewn room** filled with **dust and cobwebs**. You feel **uneasy**, the **pit of your stomach twists**, your **hair stands up on end**, and your nostrils burn and eyes water at an **acrid tinge to the air**. 

In the center of the room, standing proud amidst the rubble, is a large metal arc describing a third of a circle. It **crackles and hums** with energy growing and subsiding, giving the room an almost organic pulse.

Dust hangs in the air, heavy with static charge.

Slumped against the **Metal Edifice** is the limb of some great beast, somehow preserved, blood and gore still ooze from where it was cut clean off the body. Great talons have carved deep gouges in the stone, and you can see wicked looking spines along the limb.

### More Info:

* The metal arc is a part of a transit portal, long damaged, but still potent and possibly usable.
* Time slows the closer to the portal you get, though not noticeably to anyone within the room.
* The limb here is from a **Greater Demon** who was attempting to pass through the portal when it was destroyed. The magic of the portal, shattered and broken as it is, keeps the limb "fresh".
* If moved the limb has enough magical energies in it that it will put up one last fight, before starting to rot at a normal rate.

#### Rumor & Local Lore

* There are rumors that there are still working **Transit Portals** in **The Below**.
* Even broken magic items and edifices can be a powerful tool, if you know what you are doing.
* Some practitioners of the arcane and occult arts will buy parts of powerful beings to fuel their magics.
* **Yobrix Bramblewind** famously claimed to have been chased by a **Greater Demon**. She has used this tale to market her Tavern and gambling hall, **Faster than a Demon**.
