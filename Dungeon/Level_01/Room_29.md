A **fallen column** bridges the **chasm** ahead of you, the surface of the column worn down by countless travelers who have gone this way before.

The chasm yawns wide. A lone **lantern** hangs from a post on the far side.

A **booming voice** echos up to you, distorted and gravely.

"Welcome travelers! Welcome to my bridge! Would you care to engage in some commerce before paying the troll toll and crossing?"

### More Info:

* The voice belongs to a large cave troll, who has built a home in the chasm and enjoys engaging with travelers... 
* The troll is willing to trade or sell items it has "acquired"
* While a fierce and powerful combatant, the troll would much rather engage in a battle of riddles.

#### Rumor & Local Lore

* While there isn't much to the stereotype of trolls under bridges, a few upon hearing of the stereotype have embraced it.
