A large **hexagonal pit** gapes open before you. Thick ropes of **spider web** stretch across the **vast opening** forming pathways, platforms to walk upon, and even a balcony of sort along the perimeter of the pit.

A series of small shoddily constructed wooden buildings are lashed to, built on top of, and even seemingly built through, the strands of **spider silk**. None of the buildings look structurally sound, each one seeming to rely on its neighbors for support. Each building has **spider web** woven throughout it, securing it to the main web and lashing it to the other buildings. 
 
You see no hint of flame in the small ramshackle village, though some buildings do have a pale blue or green glow emanating from between the larger gaps in the wood.

High above in the pit, you can see large spheres of some material, suspend from yet more **spider silk**. Each sphere glows with bio-luminescent algae casting the whole area in a pale blue-green light.

There is just enough light to make out a large banner with a crudely drawn spider upon it in the center of this village.

### More Info:

* The goblins aren't outright hostile to any intruders, but they are wary of outsiders and will stop anyone from bringing fire onto the webbing, especially into their village.
* While the village is ramshackle, there is a fair amount of valuable loot contained within, often taken from the corpses of their "deity".
* The village is intended to be reminiscent of [Goblin Town](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVzjb-OcmXI), as depicted in the movie adaptation of The Hobbit.

#### Faction & Inhabitant

* The **Spider abomination** from [Room 9](Room_09.md) has allowed the Goblins to use her web to build their town. She finds their habits endearing and amusing, and has grown protective of them.
* This is where the **Goblin Tribe** that has started worshiping the Spider Abomination from [Room 9](Room_09.md), have taken up residence. 

#### Rumor & Local Lore

* Drunken adventures, and **Delvers** sometime tell stories of **goblin towns**, filled with goblins and small cramped wooden buildings. A great place to get shanked and have your coins stolen.
* **Goblins of the deeper caves** have a sensitivity to bright lights. Clever adventures will bring flares with them if they are going into **Goblin Territory**.
