The **acrid alchemical stench** lessens as you descend the **natural stone** **passage**.

The passage descends for what seems like miles, twisting through the living stone of the earth, small offshoots here and there branch and then quickly dead end.

At more than one point you walk on paving stones for a short while before returning to the rough stone and dirt of the natural passage.

The passage finally levels off, and widens into a large natural cavern. A **large metal disk** has been set into the floor of the cavern.

The disk is **polished** and covered in **intricate runes** and **geometric shapes**. On the far side of the disk the stone of the cavern floor is a single large crack, large enough for a man to climb into. 

Next to the crack the metal disk is **tarnished**, otherwise the disk is **bright and clean**.

The crack yawns and beckons to you even as you feel uneasy looking at it.
