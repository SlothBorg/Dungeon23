An **arched tunnel** stretches before you, gradually sloping downward, and just as gradually narrowing. 

**Niches** holding countless **mummified** and **skeletal** remains. They line the walls and look almost as structural as the cold stone.  

The air is **musty** and still, each breath **stirring** the dust.

Squeezing pass the protruding bones, would be tricky but doable... you hope.

### More Info:

* The tunnel gets narrower from the entrance where a large human can comfortably walk, to the point of a human having to turn sideways and be careful while moving.
* The bones protruding from the niches scratch and cut passersby.
* Some of the corpses have small tokens, semi precious stones, or other trinkets and treasures.

#### Rumor & Local Lore

* *To go down the Hall of Bones* often shortened to *down the Hall of Bones*: a local idiom, meaning to foolishly proceed.
