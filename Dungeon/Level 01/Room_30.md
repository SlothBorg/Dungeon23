You hear and smell the water in the **dank cave** long before you reach it.

You emerge into what was once a **large cistern** but is now choked with rubble. Water flows around the debris, and far above you can see the tiniest hint of sunlight.

The well shaft is made of **old brick**, **crumbling and covered in moss**.

At you feet, hundreds if not thousands of coins glint in the darkness. 

Tunnels branch off from here, most are filed in with stone and rubble, but a few are still clear enough to traverse.

### More Info:

* This cistern leads directly to a well in the city above. It was once a major source of water but recent earthquakes have limited its holding capacity substantially. 
* The water here is deceptively deep, up to 20ft in some places.
* Much of the rubble is precariously balanced and could collapse further.

#### Rumor & Local Lore

* Tossing a coin into a well is a damn good waste of a coin, but it might just buy you a wish.
* Taking a wishing coin is a gamble, you might just get the wish!
