You hear and smell the water, in the **dank cave**, long before you reach it.

You emerge into what was once a **large cistern** but is not rubble choked. Water flows around the debris, and far above you can see the tiniest hint of sunlight.

At you feet, hundreds if not thousands of coins glint in the darkness. 

Tunnles branch off from here, most are filed in with stone and rubble, but a few are still clear enough to traverse.
