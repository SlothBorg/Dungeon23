The **corridor** is filled with the mingled scent of **burnt flesh** and **ozone**. Scattered about the place are **charred corpse**.  

Some just **blackened bones**, others *fresher*.

At equal intervals down the corridor are **brass** plates set into the stone. 

---

### More Info:

* While the brass plates are the trigger plates for the trap, they are sensitive enough that all but the most careful adventurer would trigger them by stepping around them.

The **corridor** transitions from a corridor **chiseled and polished** to a **tunnel** **roughly cut** into the stone.

Increasing amounts of **rubble** covers the floor, ahead the tunnel ends in a **gaping hole** and beyond a cave in. From the hole a **foul stench wafts up**. 

At the bottom of the hole you catch glimpses of **liquid**.  

---

### More Info:

* The liquid at the bottom of the hole, is foul and filled with rotting organic matte, the liquid is deep enough to cushion a fall.
* Ingesting the liquid will sicken even the strongest adventure, falling into it, fighting in it, splashing around in it would likely splash a fair bit onto the face...
