The door opens onto a **long, wide corridor**, well lit by evenly placed **sconces** burning **long tapers**.

At the far end you can see an **open door** and before it a **large beast** **vile and foul of form**.

With a snort, the beast starts to charge!

### More Info:

* The beast is an illusion and will cause no real harm
* Fleeing from the beast, marks any holder of a **Wardstone of Cowardice** (see [Room 22](Room_22.md)) as a coward.
* If someone holding the wardsone of Cowardice either stands their ground or charges the beast, the stone will feel warm to the touch, and a single rune upon its surface will pulse faintly with an inner light.
