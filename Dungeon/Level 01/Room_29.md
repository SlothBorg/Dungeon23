A **fallen column** bridges the **chasm** before you, the face of the column warn down by countless travelers before you.

The chasm yawns before you, a **lantern** hangs from a post on the far side.

A **booming voice** echos up to you, distorted and gravely.

"Welcome travelers! Welcome to my bridge! Would you care to engage in some commerce before paying the troll toll and crossing?"

### More Info:

* The troll is willing to trade or sell items it has "acquired"
* While a fierce and powerful combatant, the troll would much rather engage in a battle of riddles.
