The room smells of **rot with an oilly note**. The steady drip of water from the ceiling above is the only source of noise and movement within the cistern.

Thigh-deep water, thick with **muck and slime**, fills the **cistern**. The area is easily 100ft across, and pillars rise at even intervals to support the ceiling.

The pillars, though worn, still show signs of **excellent craftsmanship**. Affixed to each one is the rusted remnant of a hook, meant to hold a lantern, chain, or something long ago lost.

### More Info:

* The stream that once fed the cistern has dried up, and it enters the cistern several feet above the current water level.
* Under the stagnant water the floor is uneven.
* Several corpses are hidden under the water. Most have fallen to their death from [Room 5](Room_05.md). The room itself serves as a potential treasure more than anything within the room.

#### Faction & Inhabitant

* It has been many years since the cistern has been used, and most have forgotten it is even here. 
* Among the muck and stagnant water lurks a fungal slime, (or an Otyugh, Aboleth or similar). It is currently occupied dissolving and consuming the last person to fall into the cistern, though it will investigate any prolonged disturbances to the still water.

#### Rumor & Local Lore

* Before his death in **The Below,** the adventurer **Krostrak Bluntborn** spoke of a **forbidden well** dug deep into the stone. The waters within are said to flow from the **River of Death**.
* For many centuries the city above drew its water from cisterns deep within **The Below**. In recent years a series of earthquakes has filled many in, or broken the connecting tunnels.
* The City sometimes pays a reward to **Delvers** who bring news of cisterns or other usable water infrastructure.
