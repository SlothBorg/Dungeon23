Ahead you can hear the **ringing of metal striking metal**. A work song echoes down the **tight stone tunnel**, the words strange and distorted beyond understanding.

The tunnel ends in a **broken wall**. A **large crack** runs through it, large enough to squeeze through with some effort. The crack opens into a torchlit cave. From your view point far above, you can see a **group of scavengers** digging in the **cavern wall**.

A few fill a **large wheelbarrow** and push / drag it to a sieve, searching for something in the dirt and rock.

Another small group works the bellows of a forge, while others smash rocks or keep an eye out.

A tattered and smudged red banner with a toothy grin in black hangs in the midst of their **makeshift camp**.

### More Info:

* The scavengers have found a shaft pit similar to the one in [Room 3](Room_03.md) that was used to toss trash. They have been making a decent profit searching through the old trash for bits and bobs they can sell.
* They are willing to trade, though most of their items are scavenged.
* They do have a working forge and have been melting down bits of metal into ingots.
* They will gladly charge a fee to allow "visitors" to rest in their camp.

#### Faction & Inhabitant

* These are the scavengers who put up the warning in [Room 5](Room_05.md)

#### Rumor & Local Lore
