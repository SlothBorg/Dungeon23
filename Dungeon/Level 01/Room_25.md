The **short corridor** opens onto a **gilded room**. **Beautiful ornate mirrors** line the wall.

In a few spots around the bottom of the wall you can make out **faint scratch marks**. 

Within the mirror you see the moments of your greatest successes and pride. The figures within beckon you, and their voices migle with the treasured memories, asking you to pause and spend a moment in remembrance.

### More Info:

* The mirrors are magical, tempting those who pass before them to stay. 
* Those who stay too long risk plummeting to their doom, as pride goeth before the fall. 
* Those who fall plummet down a magically extended pit onto the pile of those who have fallen before.
* If someone holding the **wardsone of Pride** (see [Room 22](Room_22.md)) passes through the chamber without taking too long, the stone will feel warm to the touch, and a single rune upon its surface will pulse faintly with an inner light.

#### Rumor & Local Lore

* Dwarven magic often focuses on the living stone and manipulation of the space within.
