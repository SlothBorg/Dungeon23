A great **brazier** of dancing yellow flame lights this grand hall, the floors and walls are made of **perfectly cut stone**, the ceiling is shaped from the living stone itself.

The brazier sits in the middle of a **square dais**, made from a **single gargantuan slab** of **basalt**. At each corner of the dais a beautiful statue in **gleaming marble** faces outward.  

Each statue stands upon a **plinth** of **white quartz** contrasting with the black of the basalt. Set into the face of each plinth is an iron plaque with an inscription, and at the feet of each statute are offerings.
