The air is **damp and stagnant**. The sound of your **footsteps echo** off the **rough stone** walls.

The tunnel floor is cracked, strewn with scattered fragments of stone and rubble. **Rivulets** of water drain into the cracks leaving a sheen of **algae** on the rubble.

Several feet ahead of you a series of **crude drawings**, done in **faded red paint**, seem to depict a warning of some sort.

Half a dozen **rusted and bent** pitons lie scattered on the floor, alongside a **grappling hook** tied to a length of **moldering** rope.

### More Info:

* The crude drawings depict stylized skulls and other symbols meant identify the area as belonging to the scavenger gang. They hint at danger but not the nature of it.
* Beyond the **crude drawings**, the floor becomes unstable, and is at risk of collapsing into an underground stream. The floor has collapsed and been repaired many times.
* The Underground stream leads into the Cistern under the well from [Room 1](Room_01.md)

#### Faction & Inhabitant

* The drawings done in red mark the end of the territory of a **gang of scavengers**, and serves as a warning of the unstable floor ahead.
