A **long wide corridor** of **stone blocks** each carved with an **intricate spiral pattern**. Looking at it for too long leaves you dizzy.

Scattered along the length and breadth of the corridor are corpses, nearly a hundred of them. Dwarves, Orcs, Goblins, Humans and more, all the dead of some battle. The stillness and dryness of the air makes it hard to tell how long they have been dead, but the foul stench of rot has not yet taken hold.

Here and there, a corpse's skin is **tinged with yellow**, the skin marred by circles of many **tiny needle like puncture wounds**, **slowly oozing puss and blood**

### More Info:

* Among the corpses are a number of magical arms, armor, and trinkets that one might bring into battle.
* The bodies have yet to start decomposing, though it is not immediately clear why.
* Camouflaged in the ceiling of the corridor are several monsters just waiting for fresh prey. Their venom preserves the bodies of those they kill, allowing them to slowly consume them over a period of years.

#### Faction & Inhabitant

* The monsters lurking above are fully feral, and can not be reasoned with, but can be distracted by fresh meat or prey to hunt. 

#### Rumor & Local Lore

* The venom of certain cave dwelling beings can be used to preserve flesh, and is prized by those who can afford such luxury.
