With the **twin stairwells** and **lift** behind you, you stare out at **shattered stone battlements**. The cave stretches high above you and far out ahead of you.

Scattered atop the **broken crenelations** lay the skeletons of long dead foes. In front of the walls lay even more dead, and rampant destruction.

The sight of this **ancient battlefield** causes shivers to run down your spine.
