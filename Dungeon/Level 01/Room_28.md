With the **twin stairwells** and **lift** behind you, you stare out at **shattered stone battlements**. The cave stretches high above you and far out before you.

Scattered atop the **broken crenulation** lay the skeletons of long dead foes. Before the walls even more dead, and destruction.

The site of this **ancient battlefield** causes shivers to run down your spine.
