A **short corridor** opens onto a **cool cave** a **crystal clear pool** of **shallow water** dominates the middle of the cave.

As your gaze catches the pool, you see swirling images, you see your self... dying in hundreds of different ways.

As the shock and horror clutches you, you know each vision to be a true future, slowly as you watch the visions melt together, until only one is left.

As the visions play in your mind and eyes, you see a skeleton huddled in the corner of the room, a skull here, a skeletal hand their.

This room has seen death almost as often as it has shown it.

### More Info:

* Seeing your own death, every possible death in your future. Is a traumatic event, an event that can kill.
* Surviving the room, will strengthen ones resolve in the face of horror and death in the future.
* If someone holding the **wardsone of Death** (see [Room 22](Room_22.md)), faces the visions and survives, the stone will feel warm to the touch, and a single rune upon it's surface will pulse faintly with an inner light.
