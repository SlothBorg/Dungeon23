The metal doors creak open, flakes of dried blood falling to the ground.

A large cave looms beyond the doors, a massive crack in it's ceiling continues down the far wall and into the floor.  

The air tastes of age and death, as the doors open wide a breeze rushes out of the room.

Scattered across the cave floor are broken skeletons, scraps of paper and burnt out candles. Some Rite was preformed here.
