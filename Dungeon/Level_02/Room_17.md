The passages beyond the crystal chamber snake wand wind, doubling back, looking over and under, merging and splitting off from one another.

The whole place feels utterly alien, nothing makes sense and it strains your mind. 

Finally after an unknowable amount of time, you enter a "chamber", it is low and the walls pulse to some strange alien heart beat.

The floor is the same soft flesh like substance as the rest of this place, but there is a layer of liquid and slime that makes keeping your balance a challenge.

Throughout the room you see scattered bits of metal, and stone each piece looks warn and has strange marks upon it.

After a moment, several long segmented worms with no eyes and pronounced beak filled with too many need teeth wriggle out of the walls and start moving towards you.

### More Info:

* While walking keeping ones balance isn't difficult, but during combat, or while running or otherwise engaged it is a very difficult task.
* The bits of metal and stone, upon further inspection look like they were partially dissolved with acid and the marks appear to be those of teeth.

#### Faction & Inhabitant

* This strange room is a digestion chamber, anything entering it is treated by the worms as food, even other inhabitants of this place.
