One moment you are on the calm dark water of the lake, the darkness of the cavern all encompassing.

The next paper lanterns float on breeze swept water, a well lit island rising from the water before you. A stone tower rising before you, candles illuminate the windows on all three stories. Smoke rises in to a warm sunset from a crooked chimney.

Looking over your shoulder you see a wooded hillside on the other side of the lake. Only a slight shimmer and ripple upon the water betrays some unseen boundary.
