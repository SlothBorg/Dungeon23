The door ot the tower swings open on well oiled hinges. Before you is a cozy round room with stone floor a fire flickers in a hearth, and wall to wall book shelves save for the space on the far wall devoted to a curved staircase leading upwards.

The table in the middle of the room holds several tall and teetering stacks of papers and books, and a basket of fruit. 

Under the stairs are small drawers and cabinets, some overflowing with things.

The whole place smells of old paper, fire and fresh bread.

As you enter, you hear the shuffling footsteps of someone on the wooden floor above you, followed by the heavy thud of a walking stick or cane.

A booming, and aged voices fills the space:

*Who enters my home!*

a moments pause

*Have you brought any butter?!*
