As you near the cold stone of the cavern wall, you see a large **metal** door set into it.

Inscribed upon the door are runes and intricate geometric shapes, twisting, merging and splitting apart. Looking at it start to make your head hurt.

On several of the sharper angles you notice traces of dried blood. In the shallow water before the door a shattered skeleton lakes on the lakes bottom.

### More Info:

* The runes and shapes form a building intended to keep the door shut, and the demon beyond sealed within.
* Blood spilled upon the door, will temporarily weaken the binding enough to allow entrance in... those of the same blood may exit before their blood dries.
* The bindings are similar to those in [Level 1, Room 31](../Level_01/Room_31.md)

#### Faction & Inhabitant

* The fish folk try and avoid this place, though on certain holy days a group of priests will come to make sure the bindings are intact.
* Fish folk will regard anyone entering as tainted and an agent of the ancient evil beyond.
* Should a group somehow manage to defeat the evil beyond, the fish folk would regard them as a great and terrible hero. Someone to venerate but to keep far away, much as one would worship a volcano.  

#### Rumor & Local Lore

* Many things are locked away far below. Most of those things are best left in the deep and dark undisturbed.
