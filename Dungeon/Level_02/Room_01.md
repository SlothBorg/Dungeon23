The passage descends to a **vast open grotto**, stalactites and stalagmites meet forming great curving pillars.
You can't see any sign of the far side it is so expansive. The vast underground lake is **clear and calm**.

A **short beach** of **smooth black pebbles** leading into the water. Before you a **pier** made of a **single solid slab** of **black stone** juts far out into the lake.

The air is **cool and damp** reeking of **rotting fish** and **salt**. 

As you watch a **strange leaf shaped** **boat** glides up to the dock and four **fish folk** hop onto the pier and start hurriedly unloading buckets of rotting fish. They keep glancing over their shoulders at the lake. It quickly becomes apparent why, a large wake is forming and moving towards the pier, as if some large beast was swimming to the surface.

The fish folk, seem oblivious to your presence.
