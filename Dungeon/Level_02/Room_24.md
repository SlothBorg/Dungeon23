The tunnel opens into a large half flooded cave, dominated by the broken wreck of a wooden ship. 

The ship is too large to have entered the cave by any of the existing entrances. 

Tied to the front of the ship is a corpse of a human male, still dripping blood. 

The eyes and tongue have seemingly been burned away, as you look the mutilated head turns towards you in a silent scream.
