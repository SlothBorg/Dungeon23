The hatch into the cargo area is rotten, held together only by rusted bands of metal.

Inside, the hold is filed with rot and filth. Here and there among the muck you see scattered coins of gold and silver.

Against the far wall you catch a glimpse of movement as two skeletons struggle against chains holding them tight to the hull.

### More Info:

* The two skeletons are the only crew who sided with the captain.
* If freed before the captain they will attack those who free them. 
* There is a sizable sum of coins in the muck if anyone spends the time to dig through it.

#### Faction & Inhabitant

* The skeletons are still loyal to their captain, even if they lack any of the intelligence they had in life.
