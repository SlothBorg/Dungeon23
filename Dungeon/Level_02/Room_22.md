The battle now left behind, this room provides a moment of respite. 

As you catch your breath you take in the details. The long low chamber of black smooth stone is broken only be a large fissure on the far side.

A dull glow emanates from the fissure, blue and flickering.

Peering over the ledge you can see far, far below more strange machinery like that in the prior chamber.

A steady stream of water falls down the far side of the fissure, it leaks from cracks in the wall.

### More Info:

* Players who are attuned to mana, can feel it flowing down into the fissure. As if being pulled in.
* The cracks in the wall can easily be widened, and doing so leads to an underwater cavern in the lake far above.
