You climb down the worm things gullet, a strange experience as it's flesh helps you down forming hand holds and undulating to meet your feet.

You reach a "chamber", the word seems wrong, a flash squishy fleshy floor, and walls of the same arch over you. 

In the midst of this place, a large dark crystal hums with unseen energies.

Above it a mass of tentacles floats manipulating the crystal in some unfathomable manor.

As you watch it slowly turns and a great unblinking eye with a star shaped pupal fixes it's gaze upon you.
