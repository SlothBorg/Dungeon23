A short tunnel off the cave leads upwards to a large ledge of smooth stone.

Piled against one wall are broken boxes, barrels and other containers. Among the smashed remnants you see scraps of food, cloth and other trade goods.

Carved upon the rocky cliff face is a large stylistic flower blossom, inlaid in the very center is a single dimly glowing red crystal.

On each petal is an intricate series of runes and arcane scripts.

As you puzzle over the strange craving, you hear a rustling noise coming from the pile of rubbish.

A high pitched voices calls out to you, *I was worried for a moment there, thought you were the trolls again... silly me*

A small humanoid in a dirty purple robe crawls out of the rubbish pulling a book and a sack.

*Mind lending me some help in my research? Even if it's just keeping an eye out for the trolls. I'll make it worth your time!*
