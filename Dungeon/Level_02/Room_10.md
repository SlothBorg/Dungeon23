The stairs open into the large space under the high peeked roof of the tower. 

Herbs and other strange things dry in bunches from the rafters.

A brick chimney runs up and through the roof in one corner.

All around the place are chests and crates filled with who knows what.

Under the dust you can see precisely drawn patterns and runes.

### More Info:

This area now serves as storage but once served as a summoning area, it is also where the magic to transport this island was preformed.
