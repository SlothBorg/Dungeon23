The long tunnel finally levels out into a damp cave, a stream through it and down the tunnel. 

The cave opens onto the lake, a small fire flickers inside the cave. 

Hunched around the fire are three enormous shapes, one starts moving and based on the noises you guess it is sniffing the air.

*Something I smell*

A deep gravelly voice booms.

*I smell too* a second similar voice echos.

All three turn and look right at you.

### More Info:

* The three are cave trolls, currently enjoying the roasted remains of a Fish Folk.
* They are more curious about interlopers than hostile.... at first.

#### Faction & Inhabitant

The cave trolls have long been in conflict with the Fish Folk. They are more than happy to provided direct aid against the Fish Folk.

#### Rumor & Local Lore

Rumors of trolls feasting on raw flesh are exaggerated. Rumors of their strength are not exaggerated. While most are dumb enough are clever that it's dangerous to assume trolls are dumb.
