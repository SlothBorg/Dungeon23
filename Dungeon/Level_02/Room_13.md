A large stone building carved into and out of a single massive stalagmite, looms out of the gloom in front of you.

No lights shine from inside, across its surface you can just barley see arrowslits and murder hole.  

This large fortress Stands before you and the Fish Folk city proper.

Unknown Fish Folk eyes watch you as your craft glides across the water. 

At the foot of the tower, a low dock surrounds the whole island.

#### Faction & Inhabitant

* The guard of the tower have sworn a sacred oath and taken the tower to be their one and only deity.
