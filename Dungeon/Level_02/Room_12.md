A dozen towers rise out of the lakes dark waters in a large ring, the furthest towers you can just make out as dark shadows among the gloom.

Atop the closest towers you can see the shapes of Fish Folk.

Between the towers, a city has been built on the small rocky islands that dot this lake. Between the lakes boats and floating platforms form walkways and low buildings.

As you peer into the gloom you can see hundreds of buildings, some lit with bioluminescent algae and some dark.

### More Info:

These towers form the perimeter of the Fish Folk city, if it ever had a proper name it is now forgotten under the thousands of discarded names it has been called. 

Travelers are rare but welcome, trade is abundant even if goods are not.

#### Faction & Inhabitant

At any given time the city is divided into dozens of factions each aligned with one of the strange "deities" of the fish folk.
Fish Folk hold opposing "deities" as anathema and attack their followers with fervent blood lust.    

However when a new "deity" arises any former amity or animosity is forgotten and only the new factions matter.

It gives the whole society a chaotic ever shifting feel, and also means most acts are quickly forgiven and forgotten ... at least acts of their own kind.

#### Rumor & Local Lore

* Fish Folk are fine hosts, as long as you enjoy their cuisine
* Fish Folk like trinkets and baubles that glint and glisten
