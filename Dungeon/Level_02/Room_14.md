The Fish Folk city is a collection of buildings built on top of one another. 
On the small islands and spilling onto the boats and floating platforms surrounding it.

Among the crowds you see non Fish Folk, a group of elves, a party of dwarves, the scaled backs of some LizardFolk a cloaked human.

All and more come to this dark city to trade far away from prying eyes.
