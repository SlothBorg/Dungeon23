The stairs leading to the second floor of the tower creak with each step.

The second floor is much like the first, a large round room, a wooden floor, more bookcases. Instead of a fireplace there is a bed and wardrobe. 

A large rug covers most of the central part of the room, two black cat lounge upon the rug.

Another set of stairs leads to the final floor of the tower.

The room is warm and cozy, with a tinge of herbal fragrance. Books and scraps of notes are piled everywhere. A workbench in one corner is covered in strange devices beakers and flasks.
