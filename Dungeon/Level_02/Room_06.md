You hear the rush of water falling a great distance, and feel the water around you gathering speed rushing towards an unseen precipice.

Looming out of the gloom ahead of you, are two stone towers squat and flat topped. Stretched between them is a metal chain net.

The net extends from each tower to the cavern wall. 

As you approach you see slight movement atop the left watchtower.
