Corpses are strewn across the first several yard of the passage. The passage widens into a **large gallery** with a ceiling only a bit taller than a grown human.
**Side passages** branch off and seemingly merge back into the main cave, giving a **labyrinthine** feeling to the space.  

In the corners of the area, are **piles of bones** that have been **gnawed clean** of any flesh.

Out of the corner of your eye, catch movement in one of the side passages. A **chittering noise** echos off the cold stone, and they abruptly dies.

The air is heavy with the stench of **death** and **putrid meat**.

### More Info:

The cave exits directly to [Room 3](Room_3.md), a few of the side passages open into the stream leading from [Room 1](Room_1.md) to [Room 6](Room_6.md), providing the **ghouls** with their only source of fresh water.

The main cave is 7ft high, the side passages are twisting and narrow, as often as not they dead end in small alcoves scratched into the cold rock.

The **ghouls** are more curious than anything, it's been a while since living beings have entered their lair.

#### Faction & Inhabitant

* The cave system is home to a pack of **ghouls**, they leave the bones in this main area, but bring any items of note into a treasure room in one of the side passages.
* The **ghouls** have gone feral, so reasoning with them will be hard, but not impossible.

#### Rumor & Local Lore

* Packs of corpse eaters live in **The Pit**, devouring any corpse that is not properly consecrated.
* **Ghouls** are not unintelligent, they can be reasoned with through bribes of meat and trinkets that remind them of their prior life.
