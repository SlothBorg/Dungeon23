The sloping **passage way** is broken and filled with rubble ahead, a gaping hole in the ceiling and floor. Some great tunneling beast clearly came through here.

As you look at the rubble, you notice a **scale** and then another, all dusty with dirt. A **large tooth** is embedded in a slab of stone.

The passage shudders with far off movement.
