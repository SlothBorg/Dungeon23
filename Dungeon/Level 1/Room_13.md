A **large wooden shaft dangles** from the ceiling. A **wicked looking blade** lies **broken and rusting** under it.

A **skeleton cleaved in two** lays further down the short hall that opens into a **large circular domed room**, in the center of which is an **altar** **chiseled from glistening black glass**.

Facing you from across the circular room is a squat statue made of black metal. Its eyes are chunks of red glass dull in the dim light.

Atop the altar, you can just barely make out the shapes of items: a bowl, some stones, and more.

### More Info:

* The first swinging blade is broken, but there are two more in "working" condition.
* The altar is made from obsidian, and is still hot to the touch.
* Atop the altar rests a long curved sword, its blade and hilt blackened as if by soot.  
* Unless the proper invocation to a now **dead fire deity** is said, the statue will animate upon removal of the sword.

#### Faction & Inhabitant

* The Golem "belongs" to **The Cult of the Blackened Flame** a now much diminished fire cult, that is less sinister than the name sounds. They would likely view the return of the Golem as the return of a long lost relic. 

#### Rumor & Local Lore

* Many small treasure rooms and reliquaries lie hidden in **The Below**, but be warned for they are often trapped and guarded.
* Golems are controlled through simple command words, phrases or invocations. Find the proper phrases and a golem can become a powerful tool.
