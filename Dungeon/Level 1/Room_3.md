You emerge from the narrow tunnels and passages of **the catacombs**, stepping out onto a **small stone outcropping** at the edge of a **large pit**.

A short jump down from the outcropping, is a mass of **putrefying flesh** a **nauseating stench** rolls off of it in waves.

How far below that the true bottom of the pit is, you can not guess.

A body falls silently from above plummeting to mass of **rotting flesh**, as it impacts, the mass of **decaying matter and bones** shifts slightly and you are hit again with the **nauseating stench**. 

On the far side, you make out the opening to another passage, half obscured by corpses.
