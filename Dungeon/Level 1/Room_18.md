The **flooded hallway** opens into a **spacious round room**, a **pocket of air** trapped against the **domed celling**.

The **frescos** that once decorated the dome have faded and are coated in **mold and algae**.  

The air is **stale and moldy**, but it is air.

### More Info:

* The faded frescos are three different depictions:
  * The sun rising over a mountain erupting from the sea.
  * The sun at high noon above a city built into the mountain
  * The sun starting to set as dwarves stand outside the mountain city defending it.
* The frecos are done in an almost cyclical nature.
