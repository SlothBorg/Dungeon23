You step out onto a **roughly chiseled stone balcony**, bellow you dozens perhaps a hundred **touches and lanterns** light a **vast cavern** dotted all over with **pits**.

The vast space distorts the noise and voices of the **hundreds of goblins** that toil in and around the pits. Crude **wood and metal machinery** sprout from the edges of the pits, many of which are **filled with liquid**.

At one of the closer pits, you watch a crane lower a thrashing goblin into the liquid, several long moments later the crane starts to raise, what comes out of the pit can not be described as a goblin.

It is far larger, and muscle bound than any goblin, almost ape like in posture, and larger than a grown man. 

Peering over the balcony, you can see a pile of the **failed experiments** rotting below.
