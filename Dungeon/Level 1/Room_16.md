Ahead you can hear the **ringing of metal striking metal**, a work song echo down the **tight stone tunnel**, the words strange and distorted beyond understanding.

The tunnel ends in a **broken wall**, a **large crack** runs across it large enough to squeeze through with some effort. The crack opens into a torchlight cave, from your view point far above, you can see a **group of scavengers** digging in the **cavern wall**. 

A few fill a **large wheel barrow** and push / drag it to a sieve, searching for something in the dirt and rock.

Another small group works the billows of a forge, others smash rocks or keep an eye out. 

A tattered and smudged, red banner with a toothy grin in black hangs in the midst of their **makeshift camp**.

* They are willing to trade, most of their items are scavenged. 
* They do have a working forge and have been melting down bits of metal into ingots.
* They will gladly charge a fee to allow "visitors" to rest in their camp.
