The **damp** fills your nose, before you see the **waist-deep waters** that fill the **wide hall** with **arched ceiling**.

Four **statues** line each side, tall imposing figures **worn down to be featureless**. You struggle to tell them apart, all you can make out is that they are dwarves. Each one clasps a rod or scepter in their hands.

A **corpse floats face down** in the **murky water**, a hole burned clean through the torso.

At the far end of the hall **arched doorways** flank a **large statue**, larger than all the rest, and sitting down. One of the doorways leads up, the other leads down into yet more murky water.

The large statue's eyes glint in the dim light.
