The path is split down the middle by a crevasse that descends into impenetrable darkness.

The sound of dripping water echoes up from its depths, other than that a single thick rope drops into it anchored securely to the floor by several thick iron spikes..

### More Info:

* The crevasse is in actually only 30 or so feet deep, the darkness and sound are all an illusion.
