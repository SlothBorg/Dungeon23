Stepping through an arched passage you enter a large tiered pit, each concentric tier is covered in sand. Matted and stained with blood.

At the center of the inverted ziggurat stands a large orc, or ogre it is hard to tell from the distance. Upon spotting you it raises it's arms and roars.

Clearly a challenge.

### More Info:

* If those who enter do not take up the challenge and instead leave, a regal voice booms out *coward*
* If they take up the challenge and are successful the same voice booms *champion*

#### Faction & Inhabitant

* The beast in the pit is a loyal champion of the Lord of the Maze.
* The champion will engage in some conversation before growing tired and demanding satisfaction.

#### Rumor & Local Lore

* Deep in the below is a massive maze built in the natural caves and tunnels., lorded over by a mad Minotaur, or so the rumors would have it.
