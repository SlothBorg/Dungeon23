The corridor is super-naturally dark, seeming draining the light from around it.

And yet you can see movement within the pure darkness, strange shapes and whispers.

### More Info:

* Despite the ominous signs there is nothing actually within the darkness.
* Any non-magical source of light brought with in the darkness, is suppressed for as long as it is within the darkness.
* Magical light sources brought within the darkness have a chance of being suppressed. If they are not they only provided dim light, and enhance the appearance of movement and the strange whispers.
