The arched hall of blue tile opens into an impossibly vast chamber. The your feel the hair stand up and the air is heavy with ozone and static. 

Far far above dim lights twinkle like stars, and you feel more than hear the low rumble of far off thunder.

Before you a massive Ziggurat of pale blue glass rises into the darkness, each level lit from with in by some crackling energy. 

A set of stairs faces you, each star inscribed with glowing runes and images.

As you gap in awe at the site before you a back of hunched hooded figure discussing something in low murmur bustles pass you and starts up the stairs.

Slowing once to bow in respect to a group of similarly attired figures descending.
