A small iron bound wooded door set into the side of the bottom of the inverted ziggurat.

Beyond is a tight room, a bench, a wardrobe a wall full of arms and armor and a small cot. On a small shelf above the cot are seemingly the only things of value. A series of miniature polished metal statues and plaques, speak of the owners prowess in the arena.  

The slight hint of smoke permeates the air with no obvious source.
