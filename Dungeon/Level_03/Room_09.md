Mirrors line this 60ft straight section of maze ahead of you.

Several of the mirrors are shattered their broken frames hung around bloodied and slumped corpses.

As you look down the hall you catch hints of movement, surly just shadows from the light reflecting off so many mirrors ... surly.

### More Info:

Each mirror shows a different loved one, friend, rival or person that the viewer has a strong emotional connection with. If no such person exists instead fears, hopes and other strong emotions are shown.
Each mirror tempts the person to stay and talk. Eventually trying to convince the person to either come join them in the mirror realm, or pull the mirror person into the "real world".
