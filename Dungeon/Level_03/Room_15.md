The twisting corridors and tunnels of the maze open into a spacious library.

The bright warmth of candles and a roaring fire are a welcome relief from the darkness.

Peering through the open doorway, you see that it is a library, filled with shelves and shelves of books, each glowing with an ethereal light.

The room is spacious and clean, high vaulted ceilings and smooth, polished floors. The air is thick with the musty scent of old parchment and ink.

you notice that the books seem to be organized by subject matter. Some of them appear to be ancient tomes of lore and legend, while others are clearly scientific treatises or historical chronicles.

There are even a few volumes on magic, with titles written in shimmering silver ink.

A person so shriveled and bent as to be almost desiccated sits at a table, running it's hand over page after page, furiously scribbling notes on the same page of paper.

In a far corner you see the mummified corpse of some long dead being clutching a book, the corpse eyes are black pits, several pairs of glasses lay at it's feet.
