You feel the air warming as you walk on, growing hotter and hotter till the sweat stings your eyes.

Rounding a bend in the tunnel you see the the tunnel descend steeply onto a series of metal grate suspended over a river of lava by thick chains.

Each of the grates is seperated by several feet, a risky and terrifying jump.
