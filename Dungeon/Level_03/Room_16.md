The hall widens into a cave 20ft across. A large brazier of burning coal sits in the middle of the chamber throwing flickering shadows across the room.

The shadows dance across the cobblestones accentuating their unevenness and play across the skeletal corpses in the corners of the chamber.

Out of the corner of your eye you see a shadow move and take the a humanoid form gliding closer, and then dissolves...

You wish it were only a trick of the light.
