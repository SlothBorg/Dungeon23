The air is damp and heavy with the smells of stagnant water and muck. 

You can't see much of the halls detail, from feel you can tell it slops down and then levels off with a few inches of water and muck.

At the far end of the hall you can see the welcome light of a fire, it's light does nothing to light the darkness of the hall.

### More Info:

* The hall has many hidden pits and shafts obscured by the darkness, water and muck.
* Some are only a few inches deep, others are several feet or even tens of feet deep.
