You descend a short flight of steps into a low hall. The air is heavy with the scent of sweat and blood, yet you see no sign of the source.

The floor is sand, in the gloom you can see cracks or slits in the walls. As you study the room you hear a grinding of metal on stone behind you., looking back you see a portcullis lowering fast!

---

### More Info:

It is possible to jam up the portcullis, or rush under it. 

Once lowered, hidden archers will unleash a volley or three. 

#### Faction & Inhabitant

This trap is laid by a gang of Minotaurs, seeking to prevent the unworthy from making it further in the maze. They do not fight to the death, instead fleeing when too injured.
