The black iron door looms before you, sulfurs fumes leaking from around it's frame. 

It opens shockingly smoothly.

Before you is a scene that assaults your sense, you can smell the scent of of your own hair burning in the pure heat.

The room is vast and cavernous, plain and empty but for two things. A throne of pure fire in the center of the room, upon which some fiend sits casually, almost tauntingly.

Around the throne is a ring a black powder.

*Welcome! enter and stay a while friend...* The words burn as they echo through the space, even in the oppressive heat the malice behind them chills you to your core.
