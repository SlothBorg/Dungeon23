You round a corner and come face to face with a door made of heavy, weathered wood.

Pushing it open, you find yourself in a room that seems to absorb all light.

The walls of the room are made of rough-hewn stone. The air is thick with a musty smell, the only sound is that of your own breathing.

The room is completely dark, and you can barely see your own hand in front of your face. The only source of light comes from a small torch mounted on the far wall, flickering weakly in the still air.

As you move further into the room, you begin to realize that it is much larger than you first thought. 

As your eyes adjust to the darkness, you start to see shapes moving around the edges of the room. 

The creatures are humanoid, but twisted and deformed, with long, spindly limbs and huge, unseeing eyes. They seem to be made of darkness itself, absorbing any light that comes near them.

As you  move closer to the torch and it's feeble light, the creatures become more frantic, their movements quickening and their hands clawing at your clothes.
