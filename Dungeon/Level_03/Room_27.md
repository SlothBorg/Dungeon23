The passage forks, one branch continue on into dim darkness.
From the other branch the air is hot and dry, the heat of an intense fire.

The walls are made of charred stone, streaked with veins of molten lava. Some of the stones of the floor glow a dull read with hear.

Dominating the center of the room is a massive black furnace belching heat and smoke.

The front is shaped like a large grinning mouth, you can see piled within coal and wood.

A large orc in a sweat drenched work coat stands gesturing and arguing with two dwarves.

On the far wall tools and weapons hang in neat rows, over a black iron door stuffed with spikes.

The Dwarves and Orc seem oblivious to you as they argue in a harsh tongue.

### More Info:

* The Dwarves and Orc are arguing in the demonic tongue.
* If pressed they will lie skillfully about a disagreement over payment for a weapon, this is more half truth than out right lie.
* The Dwarves run the forge and will gladly sell any of there finely crafted items, at a discount if they think it'll rid them of interlopers.
