A great chasm splits the hall in two.

The burnt wood and chard metal are all that is left of the bridge that once spanned this gap.

Far bellow you can see the glow of molten rock, the air is thick with the sulfurous fumes of lava.

### More Info:

* The gap is far enough to be a very difficult jump, and the fall is dangerous enough to dissuade the over confident.
