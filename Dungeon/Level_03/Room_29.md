The tunnel merges with several others widening out into a grand hall of slate flagstones.

The arched ceiling and walls are all tiled with small blue tiles of different hues making wild patterns reminiscent of lightning and storms.

A large minotaur in flowing blue and white robes over dark steel armor, stands blocking the far end of the hallway. 
Hands rested over a large axe.

*Who comes to the hall of **The Storm King**?*

### More Info:

* 1 in 1,000 of these tiles is magical, but the overall magical aura of so many magics in such a small area masks which ones are magical.
* The magical ones when crushed or damaged produce an electrical shock. 
* If combat takes place in the tunnel there is a 1 in 6 chance that one of the magical tiles is broken.
* The minotaur is a brutal combat opponent, and will fight to the death to protect the passage.
