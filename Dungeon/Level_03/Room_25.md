The long hallway, perhaps 50ft or longer, is bisected by a low wall that runs down the middle of it. 

Along the top of the wall a shallow channel has been chiseled and filled with foul smelling oil.

### More Info:

Once characters have ventured about halfway down the hall, a group of goblins jumps out from the far corner cackling, and lights the oil.
The resulting fire roars down the low wall and burns anyone in the hall way before subsiding down into a low dancing flame.

#### Faction & Inhabitant

* The goblins are members of an lose band of Goblins that have been cast out of other tribes in **The Below**
