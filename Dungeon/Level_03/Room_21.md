The corridor is hewn from natural stone, water drips from myriad natural fissures in the stone.  

An ornate door is set into the stone.

Peering through the grated window set into it you catch glimpses of light and shadow.

A tall figure pointed hat and robes is bent over a table with charts as lights and shadow dance across the ceiling.

### More Info:

* The light and shadows are cast by a strange brass and crystal contraption upon the table and show the movements of the stars.

#### Faction & Inhabitant
