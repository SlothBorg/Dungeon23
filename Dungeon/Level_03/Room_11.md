You turn a corner and the corridor ends in a featureless wall, the floor is a gaping pit descending hundreds of feet into darkness.

---

### More Info:

It is possible to descend the pit, there are already some pitons hammered into the rock wall, they are old and rusted but still servicable for a reasonable amount of weight.
