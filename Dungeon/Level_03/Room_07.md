Turning ca corner, a grisly site fills the room before you. Blackened and burnt corpses lay scattered along the corridor. 

At the far end a red robed figure stands, surveying the scene. Glancing up at you the figure cackles *I have a fire ball for you as well!*

As the words leave his mouth flames erupt from his finger fill the corridor.

### More Info:

* There is no where to hide in the corridor, someone who is quick might have time to jump back around the corner.

#### Faction & Inhabitant

* The red robed mage while insane will listen to anyone who brings news of **The Spectral Syndicate**
