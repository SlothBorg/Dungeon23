The passage widens into a natural cave, hundreds of tiny holes and cracks dot the walls and ceiling.

The air is thick with a stench so foul and strong it stings your eyes.

The floor is slick with damp and worse.

In the darkness you here a slight rustling, as if pages of a book blowing in the wind... after a moment the noise is overwhelming and the air stirs.

A moment later you feel something brush past you and then hear the rush of something coming at you in the darkness, a strange high pitch whine fills the air.
