A short **cramped passage** of **arched stone** enters into a large gallery with **vaulted ceiling**.

The air is **musty** and **thick with dust**, aside from the entry way you see no **natural stone**, instead the floor, walls and domed ceiling are all covered in **bones**. 

**Intricately woven together**, many are inscribed or otherwise decorated. In the center of the room a **black stone basin** holds a **foul smelling liquid**. 

As your eyes adjust, you start to notice mostly **decayed remains** hung upon the wall, either lashed to the bones of the wall, or stacked to the wall with many sharpened bones.

### Inhabitant

If disturbed there is a fair chance that the corpses hung upon the walls, contain a ghost or some remnant of their former self.

Perhaps enough intelligence still lingers for them to be dealt with? 

### Faction

* A **sect of necromancers** has recently come to study this place.
* An **aged soothsayer**, has long come to this place on the **night of the dark moon** to converse with the spirits that cling to this place.

### Rumor

**Merat** a regular at a local tavern, has been telling drunken tails of how they saw a cloaked figure buying fine wire from a jeweler and then later bones from the butcher before heading to the graveyard.

### Local Lore

Children in nearby settlements are often told stories of how bad children, and children who wander off are stolen away and taken to a chapel made out of bones!
