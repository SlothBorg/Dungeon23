A short **cramped passage** of **arched stone** enters into a large gallery with **vaulted ceiling**.

The air is **musty** and **thick with dust**, aside from the entry way you see no **natural stone**, instead the floor, walls and domed ceiling are all covered in, or made from **bones**. 

The bones are **intricately woven together**, many are inscribed or otherwise decorated. In the center of the room a **black stone basin** holds a **foul smelling liquid**.

As your eyes adjust, you start to notice mostly **decayed remains** hung upon the wall, either lashed to the bones of the wall, or stacked to the wall with many sharpened bones.

### More Info:

The basin is made from obsidian but dulled with soot from the many ritual fires that have been burnt in it.

It is possible, through the use of the right ritual and proper sacrifice to use this basin to commune relatively peacefully with the ghosts tied to this place.

#### Inhabitant

If disturbed there is a fair chance that the corpses hung upon the walls, contain a ghost or some remnant of their former self.

Perhaps enough intelligence still lingers for them to be dealt with? 

#### Faction

* A **sect of necromancers** has recently come to study this place.
* An **aged soothsayer**, has long come to this place on the **night of the dark moon** to converse with the spirits that cling to this place.

#### Rumor & Local Lore

* **Merat** a regular at a local tavern, has been telling drunken tails of how they saw a cloaked figure buying fine wire from a jeweler and then later bones from the butcher before heading to the graveyard.

* Children in nearby settlements are often told stories of how bad children, and children who wander off are stolen away and taken to a chapel made out of bones!
