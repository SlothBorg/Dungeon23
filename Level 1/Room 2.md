An **arched tunnel** streches before you, sloping downward. 

**Nitches** holding countless **mummified** and **skeletal** remains line the wall, look almost as structural as the cold stone.  

The air is **musty** and still, each breath **stirring** the dust.

Squeezing pass the protruding bones, would be tricky but doable ... you hope.
