The air is **damp and stagnant**, the sound of your **footsteps echo** off the **rough stone**.

The tunnel floor is cracked, and covered in broken stone fragments. **Rivulets of brackish** water drain into the cracks leaving a layer of **algae** on the broken stones and rubble.

Several feet ahead of you a series of **crude drawings** done in **faded red paint**, seem to depict a warning of some sort.

Half a dozen **rusted and bent** pitons lie scattered on the floor, along side a **grappling hook** tied to a length of **moldering** rope.

### Dilemma

Beyond the **crude drawings** the floor becomes unstable, and is at risk of collapsing into an underground stream, the floor has collapsed and repaired many times.

### Faction

* The drawings done in red, marks the end of the territory of a **gang of scavengers**, and serves as a warning of the unstable floor ahead.
