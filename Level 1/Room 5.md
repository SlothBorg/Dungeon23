The air is **damp and stagnant**, the sound of **footsteps echoing** off the **rough stone** of the passage.

The rough hewn stones of the tunnel floor are cracked, and covered in broken stone fragments. **Rivulets of brackish** water drain into the cracks leaving a layer of **algae** on the broken stones.

A few feet further down the hall a series of **crude drawings** done in **faded red paint**, seem to depict a warning of some sort.

A few **rusted and bent** pitons lie scattered on the floor, along side a **grappling hook** tied to a length of **moldering** rope.

### Dilemma

Beyond the **crude drawings** the floor becomes unstable, and is at risk of collapsing into an underground stream, the floor has collapsed and repaird many times.

### Faction

* The drawings done in red, marks the end of the territory of a **gang of scavengers**, and serves as a warning of the unstable floor ahead.
